Django Generic Ratings
======================

This application provides rating functionality to a Django project.

You can handle scores and number of votes for each content type
without adding additional fields to your models.

Different vote types can be associated to a single content object, and you
can write rules and business logic as an handler describing how a 
model instance can be voted.

This app comes with jquery based widgets, useful for increasing the voting 
experience of users (e.g.: slider rating, star rating).

The source code for this app is hosted on 
#Â TODO http://example.com.
